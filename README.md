# [Project 9:HR - Attrition Analytics -  Exploratory Analysis & Predictive Modeling Using Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/sbsahane12/HR-Attrition-Analytics-Exploratory-Analysis-Predictive-Modeling-Using-Advanced-ML.git)
## Aim :
> Human Resources are critical resources of any organiazation. Organizations spend huge amount of time and money to hire 
> and nuture their employees. It is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources. 
> So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it will allow them to identify the attrition 
> risks and help understand and provie necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to minimize the 
> impact to the orgranization.

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
